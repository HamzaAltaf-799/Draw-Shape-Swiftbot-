# Draw-Shape-Swiftbot-
The Draw Shape program was my Year 1 project, allowing users to create and display geometric shapes through simple inputs. It showcased my skills in loops, conditionals, and functions, along with input handling and problem-solving. This project strengthened my coding foundations and boosted my confidence to tackle bigger challenges.
